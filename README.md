# 🌟 TextPredictor

Welcome to the **TextPredictor** project repository! This space showcases our exploration into the fascinating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the lens of predictive text generation. ✍️✨

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains **two distinct projects**:

### 1️⃣ Next Word Predictor

- **Model Used**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
- **Description**: This project is designed to predict the **next word** in a given sequence. By utilizing **LSTM networks**, known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, we can generate contextually relevant words based on prior inputs. This model learns from extensive text data, enabling it to make predictions that sound natural and coherent. 🧠🔍
  
- **Deployment**: The LSTM model is deployed on **Streamlit**, allowing for an interactive web application where users can input text and see real-time predictions of the next word. This hands-on experience enhances user engagement and demonstrates the model's capabilities effectively.

### 2️⃣ Next Sentence Predictor

- **Models Being Explored**: GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence)  
- **Description**: Building on the foundation of our first project, this initiative aims to predict **entire sentences**. We are experimenting with **GRU** and **Seq2Seq** models to enhance our capabilities in understanding and generating text. These models provide a robust framework for analyzing context and producing grammatically correct, meaningful sentences. Our goal is to push the boundaries of what predictive text generation can achieve. 📖💡

## 📈 Why This Matters

By integrating and comparing the strengths of these models, we aspire to develop a comprehensive text generation system that contributes to advancements in the field of NLP. The ability to predict not just words but entire sentences opens up numerous possibilities in applications such as chatbots, content creation, and beyond.

This project not only serves as a research endeavor but also as a practical tool for anyone interested in exploring the potential of NLP and machine learning technologies.
